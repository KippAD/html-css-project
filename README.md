## **UX**

### **Objectives**
The objective of the website from the ownerâ€™s perspective is to increase the profile and revenue of their business. The aims of the site therefore are to:

- Develop an online presence that will increase the exposure of the business to more customers.

- Build a professional looking website that will increase the legitimacy or trustworthiness of the business to larger clients such as event and wedding planners, rather than relying on social media pages.

- Allow users to easily find a schedule of appearances and events so that the business can be easily located.

- Build an organized point of contact between the customer and the business by including a contact form for enquiries rather than relying on social media.

### **Target Audience**
The main demographic of the target audience falls into two categories: 

- **Local Customers** - Prospective customers that live in the area. They have recently discovered the food truck, maybe through a google search or through word of mouth, and want to know more about the business before choosing to eat there. Or repeating customers who have used the truck before and want to locate where they can eat there that week.

- **Event Planners** - Corporate event planners, music festivals, weddings, or food courts that are looking to hire the business.

### **Design** 
The design of the Pizza Brothers website aims to satisfy these two target audience demographics:

- **Intuitive navigation** - The user can easily move through the pages and content of the site using the navigation menu and clearly labeled links, making all site actions obvious to a first time user.

- **UX Conventions** - Design follows UX conventions by structuring content in order of its importance. It also ensures that the user is never overloaded with too much information at any given moment.

- **Clean and consistent design** - The design uses consistent fonts and colors throughout the site to maintain the style across the entire website.

### **Color Scheme**

The color scheme on the Pizza Brothers was generated with **Coolors**. Bright and overstated colors can easily detract from the other visual elements of the site, so a neutral palette with limited colors was chosen. 

The darker colors were mainly used for the footing and header elements with white text, and the lighter gray used for the main body with dark text. This allowed the page content to be broken up clearly into sections that give the page a balance of contrast.

### Typography

<p align="center"><img src="assets/readme-images/fontjoy.png" width="75%"></p>

---

The fonts chosen for the Pizza Brothers were identified using Font Joy. This site uses deep learning to pair fonts from the google font library in an aesthetically pleasing way.

The fonts used on the site were: ***Montserrat***, ***Roboto***, and ***Oxygen***.

### **Imagery**
The Pizza Brothers site does not include a great deal of text, instead relying on plenty of images. The reasoning aside from aesthetic purposes is that in most cases presenting a user with delicious pictures of the food will provide all of the information that they need to make a decision to use the service or not.

Whether it is a passer by or an event planner looking to book a caterer, an evaluation will be made by the user on the basis of whether they themselves would choose to eat there. Therefore images are central to the design, with the purpose of enticing customers with appealing photos of food.

Images on the Pizza Brothers site were compiled using: 

1. **Unsplash**
2. **Freepik**
3. **Pexels**
4. **Pixabay**

### **Wireframes**

## **Credits**
The gallery layout was initially built using a grid with columns that collapsed as the  viewport width decreased. I then stumbled upon this tutorial by Tim Van Damme which showed me how to make an adaptive layout using lists and flexbox.

The accordion feature of the menu section was built with methods learnt using the following resources:

1. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/bilal-pf/pen/eYZrPGW?editors=1100) user **Bilal BF**.

2. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/coding_beast/pen/PoZgYGR) user **Coding Beast**.

3. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/epjuan21/pen/QyELMw) user **Juan Fernando Ramirez**.

I want to thank my fellow code institute students for all of the useful troubleshooting and support 
found on the slack.

Also to my mentor Precious Ijegbe for his advice and guidance throughout the project.
