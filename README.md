## **UX (User Experience)**

### **Objectives**
The objective of the website from the perspective of the owner is to increase the profile and revenue of the business. The aims of the site therefore are to:

- Develop an online presence that will increase the exposure of the business to more customers.

- Build a professional looking website that will increase the legitimacy or trustworthiness of the business to larger clients such as event and wedding planners, rather than relying on social media pages.

- Allow users to easily find a schedule of appearances and events so that the business can be easily located.

- Build an easy point of contact between the customer and the business by including a contact form for enquiries rather than relying on social media.

### **Target Audience**
The main demographic of the target audience falls into two categories:  

-  **Local Customers** - Prospective customers that live in the area. Perhaps a first time customer who has found the website through a google search, who wants to know more about the business before choosing to eat there. Or maybe a repeating customer who has used the service before and is interested in checking the site schedule.

-  **Event Planners** - Corporate event planners, music festivals, weddings, or food courts that are looking to hire the business.

[Back to contents](#contents)

## **Design**
The design of the Pizza Brothers website aims to satisfy these two target audience demographics through:

-  **Intuitive Navigation** - The design makes all site actions obvious to a first time user. Navigating through the pages and content of the site is easy and instinctive. 

-  **UX Conventions** - The design follows UX conventions by structuring content in order of its importance. It also ensures that the user is never overloaded with too much information at any given moment.

-  **Clean and Consistent Design** - The design uses consistent fonts and colors to maintain the style across the entire website.

### **Color Scheme**
---
  
<p  align="center"><img  src="assets/readme-images/coolors.png" alt="A color palette generated with coolors" width="75%"></p>

The color scheme on the Pizza Brothers was generated with [**Coolors**](https://coolors.co/). Bright and overstated colors can distract from the other visual elements, so a neutral palette with limited colors was chosen.

The darker colors were mainly used for the footing and header elements with white text, and the lighter gray used for the main body with dark text. This allowed the page content to be broken up clearly into sections that give the page a balance of contrast.

### **Typography**
---



The fonts chosen for the Pizza Brothers were identified using [**Fontjoy**](https://fontjoy.com/). This site uses deep learning to pair fonts from the google font library in an aesthetically pleasing way.

The fonts used on the site were: ***Montserrat***, ***Roboto***, and ***Oxygen***.

[Back to contents](#contents)

### **Imagery**
The Pizza Brothers site does not include a great deal of text, instead relying on plenty of images. The reasoning aside from aesthetic purposes is that in most cases presenting a user with delicious pictures of the food will provide them with all of the information that they need to make a decision on whether to use the service or not.

Whether it is a passer by or an event planner looking to book a caterer, an evaluation will be made by the user on the basis of whether they themselves would choose to eat there. Therefore images are central to the design, with the purpose of enticing customers with appealing photos of food.

### **Wireframes**
---

<p  align="center"><img  src="assets/readme-images/wireframes.png" alt="The intitial design of the website designed with balsamiq" width="75%"></p>

**Balsamiq** was used to wireframe the original design of the Pizza Brothers site on desktop devices. These designs were used as a guide throughout, although the final design did deviate in many ways.

## **Credits**

### Code
The gallery layout was initially built using a grid of equally sized boxes, with the count of columns decreasing as the viewport width decreased. The final design was built after reading this tutorial by **Tim Van Damme**, which details how to make an adaptive layout using lists and flexbox.

[Link to tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/adaptive-photo-layout-with-flexbox/)

The accordion feature of the menu section was built with methods learnt using the following resources:

1.  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/bilal-pf/pen/eYZrPGW?editors=1100) user **Bilal BF**.

2.  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/coding_beast/pen/PoZgYGR) user **Coding Beast**.

3.  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/epjuan21/pen/QyELMw) user **Juan Fernando Ramirez**.
