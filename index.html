      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>
        We are the Pizza Brothers. For the last five years we have been serving
        up Italian cuisine around Brighton and East-Sussex from the back of our food truck. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at the Pizza Brothers we put effort into the details, as thatâ€™s what makes our 
        food have an authentic taste. We serve neapolitan style pizza and freshly made pasta 
        made with the best ingredients that we can source both locally and from Italy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We operate around Brighton most weeks, but can also be hired for events such as weddings
        and festivals. Feel free to get in touch with us for a free quote.
